Knowing that where does the error come from: 
   - Bias 
   - Variance
=> in order to improve the model 

--continue from ML1
  f_hat = the cp value of Pokemon after evolution => there must be a best function
  f* =>from training data, f* has been found (f* is the estimation of f_hat)
  
  assuming that 100 times of expriments ranges from simple model(y = b + w * xcp)  to complex model(b + w1 * xcp + w2 * xcp<SUP>2</SUP> + w3 * xcp<SUP>3</SUP>+...)
  a simplier model leads to a smaller variance
