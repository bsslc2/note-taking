Where does error come from

--continue from ML1
  f_hat = the cp value of Pokemon after evolution => there must be a best function
  f* =>from training data, f* has been found (f* is the estimation of f_hat)

The error come from: 
   - Bias 
   - Variance
=>Kowing the error come from in order to improve the model
  
  Assuming that 100 times of expriments ranges from simple model(y = b + w * xcp)  to complex model(b + w1 * xcp + w2 * xcp<SUP>2</SUP> + w3 * xcp<SUP>3</SUP>+...)
	  
	  Small Variance: the outputs(f*) are more concentrative 
			=> a simplier model leads to a smaller variance (BUT larger bias)			
	  			=> the functon space is larger in the complex model 
				   so that the f_hat could be included
				   
	  Small Bias: the outputs(f*) are closer to the real values(f_hat)
		  	
			Overfitting: small bias, large variance   => large error on testing data
				how? =>Redesign the model: more features / more complex model
				
			Underfitting: large bias, small variance  => Model can't fit traing data
